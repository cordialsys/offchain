# Offchain

Like crosschain, but offchain.

## Addresses

For our testing, we want addresses to add the following "crosschain" addresses
to exchange allowlists. If there is a universal address option, we should use that.

API keys should either be read only, or have full read + trade + withdraw permissions.

```
SOL 8Rub84DA2L6BH2FVKzVBxD7jp1i6o1BtrCunm51hQcg2
EVM 0x3fa26f0dc74cfa8a56cb9d5f94245524d0888277
APTOS 0x5249a0f1ccb427e6595343ef001ec18765fd325beb70fbea0a9c25807167e60d
```

Ideally tokens like USDC and USDT should be able to be used on the addresses above.
